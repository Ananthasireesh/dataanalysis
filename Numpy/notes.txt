Numpy is multidimensional array data 
lists are very slow, numpy is very fast :- 
Numpy uses fixed types 
our computer always reads data in binary, 
so in numpy a number 5 would be stored in int32 value 
lists consists so many other values like object type, size, reference count, objecy value etc
lists would need lot more space to store all the data above.

Why numpy is faster?
-> since numpy arrays are fixed type, no type checking 
-> faster as numpy arrays occupy much less space as we use diffrent things like object type, size, reference count, objecy value 
    to store the data 
-> Numpy uses contagious memeory (in lists its random memory)
    Benifits: CPU has SMD vector processing, it can be used since its contegious 
              Effective cache utilisation.(lists will have longer memeroy loading)
-> Numpy allows us to do item on item calculations 
    Ex: a = np.array([1,3,5]) b = np.array([1,2,3]) a*b will return us np.array([1,6,15])

Applications:
-> Mathematics (MATLAB replacement)
-> backend for pandas 
-> plotting (matplotlib)
-> Machine Learning
